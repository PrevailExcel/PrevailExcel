<p align="left">I have built up to 4 useful packages for the laravel ecosystem and have contributed to some; notably, the Laravel paystack package.</p>

<p align="left">I have extensive knowledge working with but not limited to the Laravel Ecosystem. As a backend engineer, my expertise primarily lies in developing robust server-side applications, managing databases, and optimizing system performance. However, I also have a basic understanding of design principles and the process of translating frontend layouts created in Figma or Adobe XD into functional code using Vue.js.</p>

<p align="left">I write clean, maintainable and scalable code taking performance, speed and user-experience into careful consideration.</p>

<p align="left">My strengths include my very deep understanding of the Laravel framework, I also have a strong grasp of data structure libraries, excellent communication and collaboration skills enable me to work effectively with other developers, testers, and product managers. I have a proven track record of using Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration, experience in integrating with external systems through RESTful and/or GraphQL APIs and a history of delivering projects with high-quality, efficient, and reliable backend solutions.</p>

<p align="left">I maintain a laravel blog on medium with over 12000+ monthly viewership as at 20th November, 2023. I write detailed solution-focused articles concerning software development within the laravel ecosystem.</p>

<p align="left">I have been invited to speak at several tech events and seminars including Tech Talk, GitHub Student Meetups and more. I have also hosted conferences in the past years with great results.</p>

<p align="left">In one sentence, I love delivering value.</p>

<p align="left">I'm open to web developer or backend engineer roles in a supportive environment where I can contribute my own quota for the growth of the organization. and freelance projects relating to web design and software development, PHP or Laravel projects, Javascript or VueJS projects.</p>
